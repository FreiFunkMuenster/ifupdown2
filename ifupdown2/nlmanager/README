DO NOT EDIT NLMANAGER SOURCES.
This is a mirror copy of python-nlmanager sources.
It was extracted and directly included here to support some usecases where
user don't have python-nlmanager already installed on their system. So we
decided to have local copy and build with it. It is the mainter responsability
to keep an updated version of nlmanager.
